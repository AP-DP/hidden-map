# hidden-map
Reveal a map as you explore the canvas with other users.

To run:
Ensure dependencies are installed with `npm install`
Run `node server.js` and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

You should have a canvas in the top-left corner of the screen where you can "draw" the map as you mouse over the area.
If you drag the mouse, the path drawn while dragging will be shown to other users currently connected to the system in different browsers.
